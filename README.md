Gforth docset
=============

If you like coding in Gforth then this docset is for you.  It works with Dash.  

The docset is generated from Gforth HTML documentation. As of version 0.7.0, this creates a docset with 809 Keyword entries (one for each Gforth word) and 90 Section entries (one for each topic or section in the Word Index).

The original Gforth HTML docs are included here (under GNU Free Documentation License 1.1) and so is a Gforthdoc2set.py script that generates a docset from the HTML.
